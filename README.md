# Battleship

Battleship is a classic strategy type guessing game, in which a fleet of ships are placed strategically on a grid and the opposing player/computer is supposed to guess where they are located. In this rendition, you'll still see the classic format we're all familiar with, just with a different stylistic twist - space and spaceships.

# Rules

The rules of the game are as follows: 

Setup: Player has their own grid, a 10x10 square. Player also has 5 ships which vary in size, including a 5-square ship, a 4-square ship, two 3-square ships, and a 2-square ship. Drag and arrange ships onto the grid.

Gameplay: Player takes turns against the AI guessing and clicking plots on the opposing grid to try and hit the opponent's ships. 

Hits and Misses: If the clicked plots corresponds to part of an opponent's ship, it's a hit. If the plot does not correspond to any part of a ship, it's a miss.

Destroying Ships: When all the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship is destroyed. 

Win/Loss: The game continues until one player has destroyed all of their opponent's ships.
